# TODOs for InGen

### First steps
Revisit the basics of bayesian modelling and sampling in a playground.
Maybe write one or two iPython Notebooks with 1D and 2D distributions

### Different Parts of the Project
#### Environment to render occluded scenes
* Work with OpenCV
* Adapt for Squares and more complex shapes -> Triangles, Hexagons, etc
##### Work with OpenCV Heuristics for shape recognition

#### MCMC-Sampler
Write the informced MCMC Sampler as a modular thing

#### additional ideas
